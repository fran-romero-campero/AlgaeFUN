AlgaeFUN is an online tool that seeks to allow researchers in microalgae to exploit omics techniques such as RNA-seq 
and ChIP-seq. AlgaeFUN provides tools to perform functional analysis and enrichment over:

* Sets of differentially expressed genes obtained, for example, from RNA-seq analysis carried out using [MARACAS](https://github.com/fran-romero-campero/MARACAS).
* Sets of genomic loci obtained, for example, from ChIP-seq analysis carried out using [MARACAS](https://github.com/fran-romero-campero/MARACAS).

AlgaeFUN is fully developed using the R package Shiny, the complete code is available from this repository.
