Cre19.g750697.t1.1	octotricoPeptide (octatricoPeptide) Repeat (OPR) Protein; contains a C-terminal RAP domain; part of Chr_15 NCL gene cluster
Cre19.g750747.t1.1	octotricoPeptide (octatricoPeptide) Repeat (OPR) Protein; part of Chr_15 NCL gene cluster; CDS should be extended by 31 codons at 5'-end: MLQFAHPSPANGHGLGSSYTSAPASPLIWHR
Cre19.g751047.t1.1	belongs to a small gene family specific of Chlamydomonas
Cre21.g752247.t1.1	belongs to a small gene family specific of Chlamydomonas
Cre24.g755597.t1.1	Contains Rieske iron-sulfur cluster domain; similar to Tic55-II; belongs to the classical family of short chain dehydrogenases [PMID: 15180984]
Cre26.g757047.t1.1	Found in Cr and Volvox but not strongly conserved elsewhere
Cre31.g758447.t1.1	probably tranposon-derived
Cre35.g759247.t1.1	contains ligand-binding SRCR domain found in speract/scavenger receptor (PMID: 14995912) and C-type lectin domain
Cre46.g760997.t1.1	Found in Cr and Volvox but not strongly conserved elsewhere
Cre49.g761347.t1.1	flagella protein of the C1d central pair projection; similar to PRIMARY CILIARY DYSKINESIA PROTEIN 1 (PCDP1); bind calmodulin in high CA2+; N-terminus is homologous to that of Hydin; very Similar to FAP221  - not clear if this is a recent gene duplicatoin or an assembly artifact
