<h1>Data Usage Policy: Dunaliella salina v1.0</h1>
<h2>Restrictions on dataset usage</h2><p><b>I would like to use this data to help clone a gene, analyse a gene family, etc.</b><br>
Please feel free to use this data to advance your studies of  <i>Dunaliella salina</i>. Please cite "Dunaliella salina Genome Sequencing Project, http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/".</p>
<p><b>I would like to do a large-scale comparison of <i>Dunaliella salina</i> to other genomes, and/or a global analysis of its gene content.</b><br>
As a public service, the Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute (JGI) is making the completed <i>Dunaliella salina</i> genome sequence available before scientific publication according to the Ft. Lauderdale Accord. This balances the imperative of the DOE and the JGI that the data from its sequencing projects be made available as soon and as completely as possible with the desire of contributing scientists and the JGI to reserve a reasonable period of time to publish on the genome sequencing and analysis without concerns about preemption by other groups.
JGI policy is that early release should aid the progress of science. <b><i>By accessing these data, you agree not to publish any articles containing analyses of genes or genomic data on a whole genome or chromosome scale prior to publication by JGI and/or its collaborators of a comprehensive genome analysis ("Reserved Analyses")</i></b>. "Reserved analyses" include the identification of complete (whole genome) sets of genomic features such as genes, gene families, regulatory elements, repeat structures, GC content, or any other genome feature, and whole-genome- or chromosome- scale comparisons with other species.
The embargo on publication of Reserved Analyses by researchers outside of the <i>Dunaliella</i> Genome Sequencing Project is expected to extend until the publication of the results of the sequencing project is accepted. Scientific users are free to publish papers dealing with specific genes or small sets of genes using the sequence data. If these data are used for publication, the following acknowledgment should be included:<b> 'These sequence data were produced by the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute'</b>. This letter has been circulated to Journal Editors so that they are aware of the conditions of access and publication detailed above.
These data may be freely downloaded and used by all who respect the restrictions in the previous paragraphs. The assembly and sequence data should not be redistributed or repackaged without permission from the JGI. Any redistribution of the data during the embargo period should carry this notice: <b>"The Joint Genome Institute provides these data in good faith, but makes no warranty, expressed or implied, nor assumes any legal liability or responsibility for any purpose for which the data are used. Once the sequence is moved to unreserved status, the data will be freely available for any subsequent use</b>."

We prefer that potential users of this sequence assembly or gene set contact  us at phytozome@jgi-psf.org or the <i>Dunaliella</i> Genome Sequencing Project co-directors  listed under <b>Contacts</b> with their plans to ensure that proposed usage of sequence data are not considered Reserved Analyses.
